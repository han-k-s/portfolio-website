                        I designed and bound a bilingual art book of Kim Nam-Jo's poetry. I collected poems that each
                        have a sense of sentimentality and alternated the original Korean poems with the English
                        translations. I titled the collection "To You" and designed the book so that the visuals would
                        work in harmony with the content.
                    </p>

            <h3>The What and Why</h3>
            <div class="one-one">

                    With several poem titles containing the word "letter" or being addressed "to" a recipient, I titled
                    the collection in the same way and designed the cover to resemble on envelope. I achieved this by
                    designing a built in stamp and cutting out a portion of the front cover to reveal part of the title
                    page.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I wanted to integrate the two languages together without distracting from the main language of that
                    page, whether that be Korean or English. So, for each spread I had the main language clear and
                    legible on the left page and the other language version right-aligned and blurred on the right page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the accordion book layout, the reader can flip through the poems one by one or spread them out
                    to see both languages at once and/or multiple poems at once.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="one">

                <p>
                    The main reason I decided to use the accordion book style was so that the reader could view all the
                    poems in one language all at once, creating a unique yet convenient reading experiences for both
                    English and Korean readers. Although the poems alternate between Korean and
                    English, as pictured above the accordion aspect of the book allows you to open just the English
                    spreads or just the
                    Korean spreads at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To help the reader know which spreads to open for one language or the other, the Korean poem spreads
                    have the upper border of the pages darker and filled while the English poem spreads have the lower
                    border of the pages darker and filled in.

                    All the imagery used in the decorative border and the full-spread image come from the Korean Image
                    Archive. By color treating historical Korean landscape photography, I was able to incorporate
                    imagery that was both culturally relevant and aesthetically consistent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the back cover of the book, I created a flap and pocket to resemble an envelope like in the
                    front cover. I placed a colophon designed like a postcard inside the back cover so even the credit
                    info was presented in a way that tied into the visual system.
