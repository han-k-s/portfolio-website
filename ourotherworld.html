                        I curated and designed a potential art exhibition for contemporary Korean women photographers.
                        Featuring artists that have an element of surrealism in their works, I built a motion graphic
                        identity that felt like peeking into another realm. I also balanced two languages with two
                        different character systems on equal footing to each other, taking inspiration from existing
                        exhibition design from institutions like MoMA.

                <p>
                    After experimenting with various titles, I decided the name "Our Other World" worked best for both
                    languages since the titles were both three words and the title in one language didn't feel forced
                    compared to the other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Diving into the exhibition design, I wanted the identity to lend well to motion graphics. I played
                    with warp, multi-directional extension, and treating the letters
                    as windows to the
                    imagery, but I ultimately chose the direction I felt was clean and simple, but still flexible.

            <h4 class="final">Final Title Wall</h4>
            <div id="titlewall" class="one">
                <img class="dark-on-dark" src="images/ourotherworld/titlewallfinal.png" alt="Final Title Wall">

            <h4>Earlier Iterations of Title Wall</h4>
            <div id="titlewall-iterations" class="one-one-one-one image-grid">
                <img class="image dark-on-dark" src="images/ourotherworld/titlewall1.png" alt="Title Wall Iteration 1">
                <img class="image dark-on-dark" src="images/ourotherworld/titlewall2.png" alt="Title Wall Iteration 2">
                <img class="image dark-on-dark" src="images/ourotherworld/titlewall3.png" alt="Title Wall Iteration 3">

                <p>
                    I wanted the title wall to be visually dynamic but also easy to navigate for both languages. In
                    earlier iterations, the designs felt either too rigid with all the text hugging the sides or too
                    confusing with the text too staggered and not arranged in an intuitive reading order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the final title wall, I struck this balance by staggering the bodies of text in a controlled
                    funnel shape except for the names and keeping each language to one half of the wall (Korean on the
                    left and English on
                    the right). Each language can be read easily on its own while having equal visual weight to the
                    other.
                </p>
            </div>

                    Korean characters are great with retaining legibility while being stretched because it is such a
                    geometric language system, and I made sure to use that to my advantage in the exhibition identity
                    and motion graphic teaser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After I extended the Korean title and fazed in the English title, I used
                    the lines as windows into the artwork. This is to give a sense of peeking into another dimension,
                    nodding at the surrealism of the photography itself.
