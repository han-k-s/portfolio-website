            <h4>Creative Directions</h4>
            <div class="project-text one-one">

                    <p>
                        No Pressure Networking’s initial task for our team was to create a brand card that established
                        the
                        color suite, type suite, and photography direction. As pictured above, the first step was to
                        present
                        three distinct creative directions for the client to choose from based on their inspiration.

                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        We captured the brand’s bright, high-end vibe by pairing vibrant colors with soft creams and
                        off-blacks. We used tall serifs to convey luxury and clean sans-serifs for clarity and contrast.
                        We also created a cohesive photo grid for each direction that set its distinct tone (i.e.
                        empowering vs. playful).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Based on their feedback, we combined the professionalism of Direction 1 with the more warm and
                        vibrant
                        feeling from Direction 3 to create their desired color palette, type suite, and photography
                        direction.

                    <p>
                        They also requested the use of a handwritten font in the logo, and we paired this
                        with a bold
                        serif font to represent both the personable and the ambitious nature of the company.

                        The No Pressure Networking team eventually came back to us for a more in-depth branding
                        guidelines document, happy with our work and trusting us to create a robust resoource that would
                        help them maintain brand consistency.

                    <p>
                        As the team member assigned to this task, I made sure to establish a cohesive visual system that
                        did not leave room for confusion, ensuring that even the thickness of lines used in their
                        branded material was accounted for. This attention to detail helped elevate the brand and gave
                        them clarity on how to represent themselves across platforms.
